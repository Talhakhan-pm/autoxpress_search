# Dialpad Interface Updates

## Overview

The Dialpad integration has been refactored to improve user experience and system architecture. The major changes include:

1. Split the UI into two separate pages:
   - Agent Activity dashboard - Shows agent performance metrics
   - Call Tables view - Displays detailed inbound and outbound call data

2. Removed database dependencies:
   - Both pages now fetch data directly from the Dialpad API
   - Eliminates need for database synchronization and data duplication
   - Real-time data without database intermediary

## New Pages

### Agent Activity Page (`/agent_activity`)

This page focuses on agent performance metrics:

- Shows overall call statistics (inbound, outbound, missed, total)
- Displays individual agent cards with performance metrics
- Includes filters for different time periods (Today, Last 3 days, Last 7 days, Last 14 days)
- Supports manual refresh to get the latest data

### Call Tables Page (`/call_tables`)

This page displays detailed call records:

- Tab-based interface to switch between inbound and outbound calls
- Advanced filtering options (agent, status, date range, search)
- Shows call recording links when available
- Supports pagination for large datasets

## API Endpoints

### `/api/agent-activity`

Fetches agent activity metrics directly from Dialpad API:

- Query parameters:
  - `days`: Number of days to look back (default: 1)
  - `refresh`: Whether to bypass cache (default: false)
  - `max_pages`: Maximum number of pages to fetch from API (default: 2)

### `/api/dialpad-calls`

Fetches call records directly from Dialpad API:

- Query parameters:
  - `days`: Number of days to look back (default: 1)
  - `refresh`: Whether to bypass cache (default: false)
  - `max_pages`: Maximum number of pages to fetch (default: 3)

## Implementation Details

- Both pages include navigation links to easily switch between views
- The pages use Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout and design
- Call data is processed client-side for filtering and display
- Agent metrics are calculated server-side for efficiency

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Direct API access eliminates database overhead
   - Reduced latency for data display

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**:
   - Agent metrics and call tables on separate pages
   - More focused user experience for each task

3. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - More detailed agent performance metrics
   - Better call filtering and search capabilities
   - Improved display of call recordings

## Usage

To access the new pages:

1. Navigate to `/agent_activity` for the Agent Activity dashboard
2. Navigate to `/call_tables` for the Call Tables view
3. Use the navigation links on each page to switch between views
