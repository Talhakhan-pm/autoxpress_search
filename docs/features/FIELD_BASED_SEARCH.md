# Field-by-Field Search Implementation

This implementation provides a field-based search approach for auto parts that builds targeted search queries based on the fields available rather than trying to normalize a single search term.

## Core Components

1. **FieldSearchProcessor** (`field_search_processor.py`)
   - Handles field-by-field search logic
   - Generates optimized search terms based on field combinations
   - Extracts engine specifications
   - Maintains consistent vehicle information structure

2. **Field Search API** (`field_search_app.py`)
   - Implements Flask API endpoints for field-based search
   - Formats user-friendly analysis results
   - Handles product search using the optimized search terms

3. **Frontend Integration** (`field-based-search.js`)
   - Connects the HTML form with the field search API
   - Handles validation and loading states
   - Displays search results and product listings

## Search Term Strategy

The field search approach uses these prioritized combinations:

1. **Year + Make + Model + Part + Engine** (when all fields are specified)
2. **Year + Make + Model + Part** (without engine specs)
3. **Year + Model + Part** (when make is not available)
4. **Year + Make + Part** (when model is not available)
5. **Make + Model + Part** (when year is not available)

This approach allows for:
- Better part search relevance by including the exact fields provided by the user
- Less normalization and filtering is needed since the search terms are already well-structured
- More accurate product matches, especially for specialized parts

## Engine Specification Handling

The processor recognizes:
- Common engine displacements (1.5L, 2.0L, 3.5L, etc.)
- Engine types (V6, V8, inline-4, turbo, etc.)
- Engine-specific terms (EcoBoost, Hemi, Powerstroke, etc.)

## Usage

### Starting the Application

To run the field-based search server:

```bash
python field_search_app.py
```

This starts a Flask server on port 5040.

### API Endpoints

- **`/api/field-search`**: Processes field-based search and returns analysis and search terms
  - Accepts: year, make, model, part, engine fields

- **`/api/search-products`**: Searches for products using an optimized search term
  - Accepts: search_term, original_query parameters

### Running Tests

To test the field search processor:

```bash
python test_field_search.py
```

### Frontend Integration

The form already includes the field-based approach. Users can:
1. Enter vehicle details in the multi-field form
2. Click "Find Parts" to execute the field-based search
3. View the analysis and product results

## Implementation Details

### Field Search Processing

1. User enters field values in the form
2. Form is submitted to `/api/field-search`
3. FieldSearchProcessor generates optimized search terms
4. Analysis is shown to the user with the proposed search terms
5. Search terms are used to find products via API
6. Results are displayed in the product grid

### Product Filtering

Products are filtered using the fields provided:
- Exact matches for year, make, and model are prioritized
- Products with the specific part are ranked higher
- Engine-specific parts are matched when engine specs are provided

## Benefits Over Traditional Search

1. **Precision**: Each field has specific meaning, reducing ambiguity
2. **Flexibility**: Works even with partially completed fields
3. **Relevance**: Products match exactly what fields the user provided
4. **No Normalization Required**: Fields are already structured data

This approach creates a more direct and effective search strategy that's less dependent on complex query parsing and normalization.
